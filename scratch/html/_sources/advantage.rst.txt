The Liveline advantage
======================

Liveline's product suite enables rapid and cost-effective automation at the factory system level.
This typically means controlling an entire production line or cell that consists of multiple processing stages.

Historically, this type of advanced process control (APC) has been costly to implement and difficult to
maintain as the plant experiences changes to equipment, products, and raw materials.
Consequently, APC has not been adopted widely beyond refineries, petrochemicals, and chemical
production, which together encompass more than 96% of all APC applications in industry. Outside of those
use cases, the majority of APC applications are no longer running after 5 years.

Automation of building systems such as lighting and HVAC used to be limited to large
facilities like skyscrapers and sports stadiums. Technology brought the cost and complexity down to a point
where consumers can easily automate their own homes today. In an analogous way, Liveline Technologies has
utilized the power of advanced AI to make factory-wide automation practical for small and medium-sized
manufacturers in a wide variety of industries.

Our proprietary AI is not an add-on to help tune or manage 1970s-style APC algorithms.
Our approach is purely AI-based from the ground up. From system modeling to design and tuning of controllers,
the entire process is highly automated. It does not require any expertise in modeling,
simulation, controls, or artificial intelligence.

Liveline's approach is ideally suited for plants that want better product quality and less waste,
and want to supplement technical talent that can be difficult to find.
