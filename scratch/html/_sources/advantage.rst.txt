The Liveline advantage
======================

Liveline's product suite enables rapid and cost-effective automation at the factory system level.
This means controlling an entire production line or cell that consists of multiple processing stages.

Liveline's approach is ideally suited for plants that want:
    - less waste
    - less energy usage and a reduced environmental footprint
    - higher productivity
    - better product quality
    - to supplement technical talent that can be difficult to find

Historically, this type of
:term:`advanced process control <Advanced Process Control>`
(APC) has been costly to implement and difficult to
maintain as the plant experiences natural changes to equipment, products, and raw materials.
Consequently, APC has not been adopted widely beyond refineries, petrochemicals, and chemical
production, which together encompass more than 90% of all APC applications in industry [1]_. Outside of those
use cases, the majority of APC applications are no longer running after 5 years.

.. sidebar:: APC or MPC?

    The terms
    :term:`Advanced Process Control (APC) <Advanced Process Control>` and
    :term:`Model Predictive Control (MPC) <Model Predictive Control>`
    are often used
    interchangeably. This is because APC software uses some sort of predictive model
    to anticipate how the production process will evolve. Based on these predictions, appropriate
    control actions can be calculated. We use the term APC, but our controls are indeed an
    advanced form of MPC based entirely on our proprietary and automated
    :term:`machine learning <machine learning>`.

Automation of building systems such as lighting and HVAC used to be limited to large
facilities like skyscrapers and sports stadiums. Technology brought the cost and complexity down to a point
where consumers can easily automate their own homes today. In an analogous way, Liveline Technologies
utilizes the power of advanced AI to make factory-wide automation practical for small and medium-sized
manufacturers in a wide variety of industries.

Our proprietary AI is not an add-on to help tune or manage 1970s-style APC systems.
Our approach is purely AI-based from the ground up. From system modeling to design and tuning of controllers,
the entire process is highly automated. It does not require any expertise in modeling,
simulation, controls, or artificial intelligence. Our unique approach enables rapid and economical

from pilot applications to a global network of plants.
