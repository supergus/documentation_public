=========================

Liveline Technologies provides factory-scale automation for manufacturers of all sizes.
We use advanced artificial intelligence to quickly generate AI-based controllers
that can adjust equipment parameters in real time for an entire production line or cell.

Our approach makes advanced process control (APC) practical for nearly all manufacturers.
Legacy APC solutions have been limited to refining, petrochemicals, and other sectors with mega-sized
facilities. Primarily this is due to cost and difficulty of implementation.

Much like technology has made climate and lighting controls practical for houses, not just skyscrapers,
we leverage AI to make APC affordable for all.
