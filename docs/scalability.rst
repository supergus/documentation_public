Built to scale
==============

Every decision about our technology stack was made with scalability in mind.

    automated stack deployment

    automated data selection (LDQS)

    automated modeling, 2-stage - physics and controls (LPP, LCP)

    automated loading of models based on production recipes

    automated monitoring of model performance; test harness (LTH)

    automated triggers for model updating or re-training

We do not have any data scientists sitting around and tuning models.
The only hands-on portion is initial mapping of data tags from the plant to our
proprietary digital controls platform (LDCP), and interviews with your process experts
so we can incorporate their knowledge about key process variables / signals,
equipment safety limits and other constraints, and what measurable outcomes are most important.

The benefit for customers? Ability to rapidly deploy throughout a plant and even a global network of plants.
The path from pilot to roll-out is fast.
